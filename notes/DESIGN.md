# Design of system

## Abstract

This system is a Spatial Simulation for mostly games applications (think like Dwarf Fortress simulation of temperature, everything that goes in Oxygen Not Included and other those type of games). It is closesly related to cellular automata.
Idea is to have a system that would smoothly, without bloat provide a system of simulating systems with provided callular data and logic of how this data changes over time in spatial manner.

## Architecture definition

### Frontend - Raylib

### Backend - GoRoutines system for cellular automaton

### Abstractions

Spatial system - full 3D model with 3D representation.
